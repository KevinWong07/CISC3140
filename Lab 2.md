Application: Google Chrome browser  
Description: Most commonly used Internet browser throughout the world

### Tasks:  
1. Web address bar aka the Omnibox

   User uses the 'Omnibox' to enter web addresses as well as search terms. 
   The Omnibox is a feature that takes the old toolbar search engine and implements it directly into the web address bar. This both saves space in the overall browser UI as well as negates the installation of extra toolbars. It also includes suggestions that are based on what you are typing in and because this is Google Search, it helps autocomplete what the user is searching. Something worthy of note, users can change which search engine the browser uses if they are not comfortable with the default Google Search. They have even added this Omnibox into their "New Tab" feature which I find personally redundant but I guess it works for them. As because this is a search bar, any user input that is incorrect will be automatically corrected and searched without the user having to re-enter their search queries.

2. Incognito and Guest Mode

   Incognito and Guest modes are two different ways the browser allows for Internet usage on public devices or in public environments.  
   Incognito mode in Chrome is a temporary browsing mode. It means that you don’t leave behind your history and cookies on the computer. The browsing history and cookies are deleted once you have closed the incognito mode. Contrary to popular belief, Incognito mode doesn't mean you are invisible to the Internet in general. Users also can not use this mode to hide their browsing information from employers. When a user uses Guest mode, they are using a temporary profile that is created for that single session. The user's history, passwords and settings are not saved onto the computer. This should not be seen as a form of protection however as this is only limited to the Internet browser and there may be keylogging programs installed on the computer system.
