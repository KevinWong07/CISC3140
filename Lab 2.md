Application: Google Chrome browser  
Description: Most commonly used Internet browser throughout the world

### Tasks:  
1. Web address bar aka the Omnibox

   User uses the 'Omnibox' to enter web addresses as well as search terms. 
   The Omnibox is a feature that takes the old toolbar search engine and implements it directly into the web address bar. This both saves space in the overall browser UI as well as negates the installation of extra toolbars. It also includes suggestions that are based on what you are typing in and because this is Google Search, it helps autocomplete what the user is searching. Something worthy of note, users can change which search engine the browser uses if they are not comfortable with the default Google Search. They have even added this Omnibox into their "New Tab" feature which I find personally redundant but I guess it works for them. As because this is a search bar, any user input that is incorrect will be automatically corrected and searched without the user having to re-enter their search queries.

2. Incognito and Guest Mode

   Incognito and Guest modes are two different ways the browser allows for Internet usage on public devices or in public environments.  
   Incognito mode in Chrome is a temporary browsing mode. It means that you donâ€™t leave behind your history and cookies on the computer. The browsing history and cookies are deleted once you have closed the incognito mode. Contrary to popular belief, Incognito mode doesn't mean you are invisible to the Internet in general. Users also can not use this mode to hide their browsing information from employers. When a user uses Guest mode, they are using a temporary profile that is created for that single session. The user's history, passwords and settings are not saved onto the computer. This should not be seen as a form of protection however as this is only limited to the Internet browser and there may be keylogging programs installed on the computer system.

3. Google Sync

   User can log into their Google account on the Chrome browser and access bookmarks, passwords and a lot more from various devices.  
   Google Sync allow users to sync and backup their browsing data across various devices. Users can also choose what specific features to sync and not sync everything for the sake of privacy. This in turns allow for users to work everywhere without re-doing their work process multiple times on different devices. This continuity factor is efficient for all end-users and while may raise privacy concerns, it is a boon to many that work in multiple locations. Google accounts also support a variety of email services during sign up so it is not needed to make an account associated with Gmail.
