Application: Google Chrome browser  
Description: Most commonly used Internet browser throughout the world

### Tasks:  
1. Web address bar aka the Omnibox

   User uses the 'Omnibox' to enter web addresses as well as search terms. 
   The Omnibox is a feature that takes the old toolbar search engine and implements it directly into the web address bar. This both saves space in the overall browser UI as well as negates the installation of extra toolbars. It also includes suggestions that are based on what you are typing in and because this is Google Search, it helps autocomplete what the user is searching. Something worthy of note, users can change which search engine the browser uses if they are not comfortable with the default Google Search. They have even added this Omnibox into their "New Tab" feature which I find personally redundant but I guess it works for them. As because this is a search bar, any user input that is incorrect will be automatically corrected and searched without the user having to re-enter their search queries.

   Incognito and Guest modes are two different ways the browser allows for Internet usage on public devices or in public environments
