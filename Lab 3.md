Job Posting: [Certified IT Administrator (LAN/WAN)](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/dcas/downloads/pdf/noes/titlespecs/13652.pdf)

I chose this position for the lab because it was already something I was looking at. This posting was however listed the previous year and I wasn't able to apply for that position as I found out about it too late. Now, why didn't I apply for other positions at other companies? Why did I choose a job posting from the city instead? Sure, tech companies have a lot of upward momentum especially for a young college graduate however, I'm looking towards taking my skills and knowledge and applying these in a more local and fixed position. I'm not looking to move upward as quick as possible but more looking into a stable position where I can grow my skills while have the job security that comes from working on a state/federal level. 

For a person applying for an IT position, one doesn't only require a college degree but also the correct certification. The most basic ceritifcation most IT personnel are expected to have is the Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) License. Cisco provides various licenses that are available to everyone that wants to pursue a career in the IT field.
